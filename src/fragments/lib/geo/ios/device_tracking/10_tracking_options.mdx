* Tracker: Name of the tracker resource in Location Service to send location data to.  The default tracker is used if none is provided.
* Desired Accuracy: The best-effort desired accuracy of location updates.
* Request Always Authorization: If true, Amplify will request Always Authorization permission to always receive location updates from the OS.
* Allows Background Location Updates: Whether background location updates should be allowed.
* Pause Location Updates Automatically: Allow the OS to pause location updates to optimize battery usages.
* Activity Type: Applicable only if Pause Location Updates Automatically is true.  The activity type is used by the OS to pause location updates to optimize battery usages.
* Shows Background Location Update Indicator: Only applicable if Request Always Authorization is true.  If true, the background location indicator is displayed and visible to the users.  This option is not supported on MacOS.
* Disregard Location Updates When Offline: By default, Amplify will store location updates locally due to loss of network connectivity and send location updates when device is online.  Set this option to true to disable offline local storage behavior.
* Wake App For Significant Changes: Setting this to true will request that the app be woken up by significant location updates after an app has been force closed. In order to take advantage of this, you'll need to call `Amplify.Geo.startTracking()` in your apps launch lifecycle method. (e.g. `didFinishedLoading`)
* Distance Filter: The minimum distance in meters at which the OS will update the app with a new location.
* Track Until: The date and time after which to stop tracking. By default, tracking will continue until stopTracking(...) is called.
* Batch Options: Custom defined behavior that allows for location updates to be batched up to a certain threshold
